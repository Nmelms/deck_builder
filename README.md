# Overview

This is a deck builder for the trading card game: Magic The Gathering. This app might be a bit confusing for people who are unfamiliar with the game but 
bascially it's a place to put together a deck to use in battles. In this project I fetch card data from the scryfall api and display it using Javascript. 
In this project I decided not to use any frameworks and just focus on the basics. You can search for cards and add them to your deck and the data will 
be kept in the local storage. I eventally want to add on firebase for a backend and some auth so users can log in and access their decks.


## Instructions
* You can do a quick search by color from the home page or open up the advanced search if you're looking for something in particular. 
* To add a card to the deck just click on it in the search screen, you should see a green check mark pop up on the card.
* If you would like to view your deck navigate to the the deck page and you can see the cards you have added. 
* If you would like to remove a card click the card and then click remove.
