# Deck Builder

This is a deck builder for the trading card game Magic: The Gathering. This app is designed for players of the popular trading card game who want to create and manage their own decks.

Although the app may be confusing for those unfamiliar with the game, it is essentially a tool for building decks to use in battles. To bring the app to life, I used the Scryfall API to fetch card data and display it using JavaScript. In order to focus on the basics, I decided not to use any frameworks in this project.

With the app, users can search for cards and add them to their deck, which is stored in the local storage. In the future, I hope to add Firebase for a backend and authentication, allowing users to log in and access their decks.
